# velo

Web app for front end of velo project from the McGill Phyisics Hackathon 2018.

An interactive physics toy for young children that helps visualize physics concepts in a playful and creative way. Created to stimulate skillsets such as problem solving, curiosity, and interaction amoungst young.

Velo is a bluetooth enabled ball that sends accelerometer data to a visual display in order to help users visualize changes in acceleration during interaction. With further development velo can be upgraded with 9 degrees of freedom sensors in order to visualize more physics concepts such as motion and impact.

Overall, velo is an interactive children's toy that aims to encourage learning through creation from play.
